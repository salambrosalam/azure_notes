Project Waterfall-Model:

Project Planning:
    Requirements:
        Analysis:
            Design:
                Coding:
                    Testing:
                        Deployment

Advantages:
    >Clear demarcation between one phase and another
    >The requirements can be solidified up front.
    >It gives the Project Manager a clear insight into aspects such as delivery dates, cost estimates etc.

Disadvantages:
    >The customer might get to see the end product only
    >Changes in scope
    >Bugs in the testing phase

Project Agile:
it's like a cycle:
>Requirements
>Design
>Develop
>Test
>Deploy
>Review

In software development, agile practices include requirements discovery and solutions improvement
through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross and cross-functional teams with their customer(s)/end user(s),
adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continual improvement, and flexible responses to changes in requirements, capacity, and understanding
of the problems to be solved

Project Scrum:

This is an agile development methodology

User Story - This is a feature that the user wants. This is written from the users perspectives.

Product Backlog - This is the list of items that need to be done. The list is based off the requirements, features,
enhancements. This is normally managed by the product owner or the product manager.

Items are taken from the Product Backlog and then assigned to a sprint. The sprint is normally a duration of 2 weeks. The items assigned to the sprint are made part of the sprint backlog.

Sprint Review - Here the team showcases what was done in the sprint.
Here the decision can be made as to whether the deliverable should be promoted to production.

Sprint Restropective - The team comes together to see what worked and what did not work.
